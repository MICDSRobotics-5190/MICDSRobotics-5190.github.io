This Thanksgiving, the MICDS Robotics Team had a lot to be thankful for.

Last Monday, the MICDS Robotics Team Technoramic 5190 kicked off the beloved annual high school charitable tradition of the Turkey Train.
Our robot drove a turkey all the way from high school to our athletic building, and after it followed 500+ more turkeys.
Along with 3000+ lbs. of additional food items, these turkeys enable the STL Foodbank to provide over 10,000 meals to people in the STL area.
After this successful Turkey Train, our team had a well deserved five day break for Thanksgiving, but we are now back and working harder than ever!
We have many exciting projects in the works, so be sure to tune in later.
