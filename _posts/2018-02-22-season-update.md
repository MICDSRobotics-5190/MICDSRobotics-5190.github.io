Lots of stuff has been going on since our last update on this website. We made it to state, got a bunch of awards, and even got a shoutout from MICDS!

We started off the competition with a rough start and we struggled through several of our matches, but in the end, we pulled through and got picked by the third place alliance captain. We didn't win our semifinal match, but we received several awards based on judging, including the Inspire Award! This qualified us for the Missouri state competition. In the end, we learned that perseverance and grace in defeat is more important than winning every match.

MICDS took note of our achievements and [gave us a shoutout](https://www.micds.org/page/news-detail?pk=1164804&fromId=207206) on the official MICDS news feed. 

Now we're focusing on getting ready for state. We'll make sure to keep the website updated with our progress.
