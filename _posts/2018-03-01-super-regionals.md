The competition at state went pretty great! We were ranked third in our division after the qualification matches, and so we got to be alliance captains. Our robot was consistently good, and although we couldn't fill up a cryptobox, getting those 85 points every time in autonomous and always getting a column and a row (*and* sometimes two columns and a row or even two columns and two rows) and parking on the balancing stone at the end was solid.

So, the semifinals start up: our alliance partners are both great at filling up the cryptobox, and one can score relics, but both only have good autonomous for the balancing stone nearer to the relic scoring. We have autonomous programs for every side, so it made sense that we would run more so that both of us get the large amount of autonomous points.

The matches are close! But we end up losing the first match, winning the second, and losing the third. Other than awards, which we didn't think we had a big shot at the time, we most likely wouldn't advance past state.

To everyone's surprise though, they went *deep* int eh advancement criteria. 11 teams qualified from that state competition to South Super regionals-- and they went to the 21st advancement criteria. And **we** were the 21st, the highest ranked team who had not previously advanced. ***We're going to Super Regionals!***

State made us realize that we would need to change our intake to stay competetive. We're gonna take Super-Regionals by storm!
