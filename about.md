# {{ page.title }}

Technoramic is the co-ed high school robotics team from MICDS. We offer robotics after school, for four hours per week. Our team values good sportsmanship, proper self-conduct, honesty, and gracious professionalism. Many of our members have prior experience in FTC, while a few came to us this year with little to no experience at all. Regardless of grade and robotics background, our members have developed a passion for the team and have bonded immensely. We have an inexorable motivation and drive to win!
