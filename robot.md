# Robot Status: *Tweaks*

Our robot is currently being worked

# Robot Technologies

Our Robot is using two REV Hubs with some of their sensors. So far we like the compactness of the new systems.

# Projected Autonomous

Currently we are working on our Autonomous, but are our master goals so far:
- Figure out what pattern is, using Vuforia
- Hit the correct jewel using an arm and a color sensor
- Move forward to place the box

To find the position of the robot using the on-board accelerometer, we are mathematically integrating the position from the velocity.
